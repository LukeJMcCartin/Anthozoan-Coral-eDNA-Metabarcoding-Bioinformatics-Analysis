# Anthozoan-Coral-eDNA-Metabarcoding-Bioinformatics-Analysis
Code and reference barcode training set files associated with McCartin et al. 2024 "Nuclear eDNA Metabarcoding Primers for Anthozoan Coral Biodiversity Assessment" for the analysis of eDNA metabarcoding data generated using the 28S PCR primers. The training sets were updated in September 2025 to include new sequences of corals collected offshore Puerto Rico and other 28S sequences from MetaZooGene: https://metazoogene.org/mzgdb/.

The RMarkdown file ("Anthozoan_eDNA_metabarcoding_analysis_20231029.Rmd") includes both R and zsh code chunks for the analysis of metabarcoding data generated using the 28S primers.
